Twitter Integration
===================

Introduction
------------

It is strongly recommended that users be able to authenticate with Twitter when using Socialize so as to 
maximize the exposure, and promotion of your app.

This provides significant benefits to both your application, and your users including:

1. Improved user experience through personalized comments
2. Automatic profile creation (user name and profile picture)
3. Ability to automatically post user comments and likes to Twitter
4. Promotes your app on Twitter by associating your app with a users' tweets

To add Twitter authentication, you'll need a Twitter Application and the consumer key/consumer secret for the Twitter app.  
If you already have a Twitter app, you can skip this section.

Setting up Twitter
-------------------

Creating a Twitter Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you **do not** already have a Twitter app just follow these simple steps:

	1. First create a Twitter app.  Go to https://dev.twitter.com/ and create a new app:

	2. When creating the app, make sure you specify a callback URL.  
	   This can be any value, and is not actually called during authentication but Twitter requires a 
	   valid URL for callback otherwise authentication will fail.
	   
		.. note:: 

			Make sure you specify a callback URL

	3. Change the permissions on the app to Read/Write
		
		The default permissions for new Twitter Apps is Read Only, this must be changed to Read/Write.
		
		Your Twitter Consumer Key and Consumer Secret is also displayed on this page

Configuring Twitter in Socialize
--------------------------------
Once you have a twitter application, simply add your Twitter consumer key and secret to your **socialize.properties** file:

.. literalinclude:: snippets/props_twitter.txt
   :language: properties
   
.. raw:: html
   :file: snippets/twitter_complete.html   

.. include:: footer.inc
